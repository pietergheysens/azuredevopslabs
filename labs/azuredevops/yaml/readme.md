## Overview ##

Many teams prefer to define their build and release pipelines using YAML (YAML Ainâ€™t Markup Language). This allows them to access the same pipeline features as those using the visual designer, but with a markup file that can be managed like any other source file. YAML build definitions can be added to a project by simply adding their source file to the root of the repository. Azure DevOps also provides default templates for popular project types, as well as a YAML designer to simplify the process of defining build and release tasks.

### Task 1: Configuring the Parts Unlimited project ###

1. Navigate to your team project on Azure DevOps in a new browser tab. Before digging into the YAML pipelines, you will want to disable the existing build pipeline.

1. Navigate to **Pipelines**.

1. Select the **ASP.NET** template as the starting point for your pipeline.

1. Review the contents of the YAML definition. It will be saved as a new file called **"azure-pipelines.yml"** in the root of the repository and contain everything needed to build and test a typical ASP.NET solution. You can also customize the build as needed. In this case, update the **pool** to specify the build should use a Visual Studio 2017 build VM.

1. Review trigger and point to **master** if you repo does not have **main** (new repos will have "main" instead of "master").

1. Click **Save and run**.
